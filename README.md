# Unicommerce-API-Sheets-Automation
A Google Apps Script solution that integrates with the Unicommerce e-commerce platform.
This script automatically fetches order data, keeps it synchronized in real time with Google Sheets, manages OAuth tokens, and allows customizable data filtering.
It also includes built-in logic to detect and prevent duplicate orders along with robust error handling.

The repository:
Download the project from GitHub.

Set your credentials:
Add your Unicommerce API credentials (tenant URL, username, password) inside the script files (such as Order Details Script.js).

Deploy script in Google Apps Script:
Upload the script to Google Apps Script and allow required permissions.

Connect to Google Sheet:
Make sure your Google Sheet has the right columns and connect it with the Apps Script.

Test the setup:
Run the script once, check if data is coming correctly, and watch for errors.

(Optional) Automate sync:
Set up time-based triggers for regular, automatic updates.
